# Introduction Todo application

> This project is made to learn the local storage of vanilla javascript
> Each new day, a list of tasks awaits us. Some of them are more interesting than others. Nevertheless, the importance of completing these tasks is undisputed, especially if they build on a daily basis.
> Normally what happens is that we are either able to complete a preset number of tasks on time or we fail miserably. Although the success rate depends on many factors, there is one common thing that is mostly seen in several use cases. That would be the use of to-do list apps.
